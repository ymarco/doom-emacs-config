#+TITLE: Doom Emacs Config
#+AUTHOR: Yoav Marco

I intend to push some of this (mostly latex stuff) upstream to doom someday.
+ [[file:config.el]] is a jumble of general config and preferences, mostly ~setq~'s
  and keybinds.
+ [[file:dvorak-config.el]] - just some simple dvorak stuff. I use vim with the
  default keys on top of dvorak, this is mostly so I can type normally with an
  another input method (be damned, Hebrew!).
+ [[file:latex-config.el]]: my LaTeX config, separate from
  [[file:hebrew-latex-config.el]] which includes all the hebrew-related stuff.
