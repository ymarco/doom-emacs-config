#+TITLE: Doom Emacs Config
#+AUTHOR: Yoav Marco

I intend to push some of this (mostly latex stuff) upstream to
doom someday.
+ [[file:config.el]] is a jumble of general config and preferences, mostly ~setq~'s
  and keybinds.
+ [[file:dvorak-config.el]] - just some simple dvorak stuff. I use vim with the
  default keys on top of dvorak, this is mostly so I can type normally with an
  another input method (be damned, Hebrew!).
+ [[file:modules/lang/math]] configure a math mode for use in LaTeX and
  org buffers. It creates the ~math-mode~ minor mode. In that module, with a
  =+heberw= flag to math module, I create a ~hebrew-math~ minor mode which adds
  convenient snippets and commands for writing LaTeX-like math in with a
  usually-Hebrew input method. It has a README of its own.
