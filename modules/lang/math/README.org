* Description
Opinionated, unified math for org and LaTeX.

Sick of having duplicate snippets and keybinds for math writing in org and
LaTeX? This is for you! Activate with ~M-x +math-mode~

+ Math snippets

** Maintainers
+ [[https://github.com/yoavm448][yoavm448]] (Author)

** Module Flags
+ =+hebrew= defines special keybinds and snippets useful for writing math when the
  user is on a Hebrew input method most of the time.

** Plugins
None.

** Hacks
~+hebrew-math-mode~ also enables ~+math-mode~, and also ~hebrew-mode~ if there's such
command.

* Prerequisites
